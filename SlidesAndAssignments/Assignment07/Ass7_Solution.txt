(*)	[...] compute the texture values at the texture coordinates (1/2,1/2) and (4/8-1/4*1/8,4/8-1/4*1/8). (1P)

Solution: 
=========
Value at (1/2,1/2): 1/2
Value at (4/8-1/4*1/8,4/8-1/4*1/8): 3/8

(1P if both results correct, 0P otherwise)

(*)	[...] Use alpha-blending to compute the color. 

Solution:
=========
R = 5/16 = 0.3125
G = 0
B = 0
(A = 1, not necessary)

(1P if R,G,B are correct, and A is correct or not specified at all, 0P otherwise)
