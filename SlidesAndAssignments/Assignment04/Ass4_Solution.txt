(*)  If the terrain geometry should be rendered using “Draw()” instead of “DrawIndexed()”, what changes would be necessary to the vertex buffer? (1P)

Solution: The vertex buffer must contain one vertex for each index in the index buffer (in the same order). (1P)

(*)   Given is a triangle by the vertices A = (3, 0, 6); B = (0, 2, 0); C = (6, 0, 0). The following RGB-colors are assigned at each vertex: cA = (1, 0, 0); cB  = (0, 1, 1); cC = (1, 0, 1). Calculate the color cP at point P = (2, 1, 2) by using barycentric interpolation. You can assume that P lies inside the given triangle. (1P)

Solution: (1/2, 1/2, 2/3)
(1P if all 3 components correct, 0P otherwise)
